# cord Coding Challenge (Front-end)

### NOTES

- TMDB api cannot search by genres
- if you select a genre it is going to search by popularity
- Meaning, it cancels out search queries eg. I type: spiderman and select movie genre thriller: it is going to ignore my query and fetch only movies with genre, among others, thriller
